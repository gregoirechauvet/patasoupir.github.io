            I like to throw MUD in people’s faces<br />

            I don‘t care of hurting them as long as I am not hurted<br />

            also I’ve realized recently that nothing matters more than myself<br />
            <br />
            throwing mud is not what I like the best, but it gradually became a
            kind of necessity, so it sort of looks like I enjoy it
          </div>

          <div class="texte">
            The other day I threw mud right into some friend's face. we were at
            a party having a lot of fun
            <br />

            But mud stains and stinks<br />
            problem : the girl keeps coming to my place saying « PLEASE HELP ME
            WASH IT OFF »<br />

            I lauph I respond « this is your body your smell »<br />

            Not my pb

            I don't understand her problem she fucking pisses me off what is she
            doing here --- just wash yourself. <br />this is my place and she
