      you would have gone crazy here - you've been sliding down my eyelids for three days. you would
      have been very happy. You see [a city we loved]? Well that's a thousand times better! Then me
      too and I'm feverishly sad because this is the only opportunity a god is giving me to be with
      you and show you something. i don't know when you put me in salt water and as it's not now
      it's never that's the failure that's the hole there's nothing but emptiness afterwards because
      you don't reassure me with anything else - or maybe it's just that we haven't seen each other,
      and you'd have liked to say something else - i'm amazed at your absence today because it's THE
      ABSENCE OF THE ASSURANCE that one day it will be good. People and relationships place beacons
      in the FUTURE to guide each other. Promising me nothing allows you to demand nothing of
      yourself. GO AWAY if deep inside you you'd rather bring anyone else but me in the water, or
      assume that you prefer to wait for the stars to align to coordinate sunshine good humour
      healthy happy body and a little money. i would have love, please, at least, to hear you tell
      me that we'll see each other somewhere else and that we'll leave this CITY of sludge where I
      (we?) have been rotting for the last 3 years - in short to hear you say that you're as
      disappointed as I am about the unfortunate circumstances and that you're ready to make amends.
      i know you well enough to assume you just haven't thought about it. It's not even reproaches
      any more : help me: what can i do with these expectations that i can't help but have, think
      about, point out, will you be less disappointing one day? Yes / no. Because i'm going home,
      i'm gnna see you again. it will be summer, and there will be nothing. Why is living in this
      city so deadening when you are in it.<br />
      i do make promises to people. and i love that it's like bridges. <br />
      I'm ready to hear anything if you tell me to go fuck myself with ideas like that it will be
      better than my swallowing when I wonder why you are in existence with me
