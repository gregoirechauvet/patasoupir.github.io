            A few days later, another post, with a comment : 'this cat needs insulin, he has mouth cancer.' which is just FALSE. <br><br>
            But after that, couldn't find my cat anymore. The evening, the day after, she's not coming back.<br><br>I call, do researchs. I meet a neighbor who says to me:
            “I saw someone taking your cat, and this person told me that it was to give it back to you.” <br>
            No one gave me anything back.<br><br>
            I have a description of the thief, I know that it is someone who claims to work for an association helping animals. Supposed to be a woman, collecting animals, and she has a cat-eating dog.
          <br>Who helps who? Can you help me find it? Are you the one who took my cat? I just want to have it back...

          I've seen a documentary about that. In Germany, the phenomenon is very common. Even in breedings it happen. Since the pandemic, people pick up some dog, and then they don't want it anymore, think they can flog them to the first refuge they find. But it doesn't work like that ! <br><br>We should make lists of the recidivists. Establish standars, maintain control. so that any time someone try to hoard a dog, or cat or a guinea pig, the vet or the refuge will say : YOU'VE ALREADY BEEN ARRESTED FOR COMPULSIVE HOARDING. IT'S TOO LATE. YOU'RE NOT ALLOWED."
